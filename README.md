### Overview of task:
Animals update their behavioural strategies based on feedback to their decisions. Decoding strategies have demonstrated neural activity related to decision making. Similarly, feedback-related responses are well-established in EEG. Frameworks such as “predictive coding”, supported by evidence from sensory perception, have been proposed to unify prediction and feedback where an internal “model” of the external world is updated based on error. It remains unclear, however, how this feedback-related activity is integrated with predictive activity.
